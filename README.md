# The Cocktail Compendium


Have you ever bought a house that has a bar and suddenly everyone expects you to know how to make cocktails? I have! That's why I'm developing __The Cocktail Compendium__. This app holds detailed information on hundreds of mixed drinks and how to make them. This includes full instructions, ingredients, glass type, and a picture of what you can expect to see. Search for your favorites by name or find a new favorite by entering what ingredients you like the most. If you have a limited number of ingredient options, The Cocktail Compendium will find you options for what to make using what you have. If there's time for just one more trip to the store, the Cocktail Compendium will recommend that last ingredient that could really open up your mix drink options. When you're not sure what you want, scroll through our extensive list of drinks to see if any of their pictures catches your eye. Or let our randomizer choose for you! Either with complete randomness or by setting some restrictions and randomizing from there. This app will even help you stay healthy by telling you calories per drink and letting you search for lower calorie options. Log your drinks in this app to track your calories for the night. And if you enter your sex, height, and weight, the Cocktail Compendium can even extimate your blood alcohol content based on what you've had so far. With a sleek and simple design (*underconstruction*), making Cocktails has never been so easy! 

It is both a mobile and desktop app so that you can always have it when you need it. 

I'm planning to intigrate a Cocktail API for the details on the cocktails\

Also a nutrition API for getting calorie estimations\

Durring development, I'm planning to use a Spring Boot framework, a Flutter or React Bootstrap with TypeScript front-end, and a database back-end.
