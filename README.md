# The Cocktail Compendium


Have you ever bought a house that has a bar and suddenly everyone expects you to know how to make cocktails? I have! That's why I'm developing __The Cocktail Compendium__. This app holds detailed information on hundreds of mixed drinks and how to make them. This includes full instructions, ingredients, glass type, and a picture of what you can expect to see. Search for your favorites by name or find a new favorite by entering what ingredients you like the most. If you have a limited number of ingredient options, The Cocktail Compendium will find you options for what to make using what you have. When you're not sure what you want, scroll through our extensive list of drinks to see if any of their pictures catches your eye. This app will even help you stay healthy by telling you calories per drink (*underconstruction*). With a sleek and simple design, making Cocktails has never been so easy! 

It is both a mobile and desktop app so that you can always have it when you need it. 

I used a Cocktail API for the details on the cocktails\

And plan to integrate a nutrition API for getting calorie estimations\

Uses React and Spring Boot both hosed on Heroku. Connects to a MySQL database hosted by JawsDB using Hibernate. An additional front end is planned for development using Flutter.
